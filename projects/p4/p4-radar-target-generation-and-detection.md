# Project 4: Radar Target Generation and Detection

## Overview

In this MATLAB project I design and simulate the steps of a radar signal processing chain. After generating a specific waveform based on system requirements and modelling a target's motion using constant velocity, I propagate the wave and calculate the mixed, or beat, signal for each time step. Next, I perform two passes of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the data, one to identify the initial position of the vehicle, the other to also infer its speed in a Range-Doppler Map (RDM). Finally, I implement a 2D CA-CFAR algorithm to remove noise induced by heat and other environmental factors, and precisely locate the target. Most tasks are timed to monitor their efficiency.

## Project Report

### Radar System Requirements

- Frequency: 77 GHz
- Range resolution: 1 m
- Maximum range: 200 m
- Maximum velocity: 70 m/s

### FMCW Waveform Design

From the above parameter specifications, the Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar [1] waveform is given by:

$$
\text{bandwidth} = \frac{\text{speed of light}}{2\times\text{range resolution}} = \frac{3\times 10^8\ \text{m/s}}{2\times 1\ \text{m}} =
 1.5\times 10^8\ \text{Hz}
$$

$$
\text{chirp time} = 5.5 \times 2 \times \frac{\text{max range}}{\text{speed of light}} = 5.5 \times 2 \times
 \frac{200\ \text{m}}{3\times 10^8\ \text{m/s}} = 7.\overline{3} \times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}
$$

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\text{bandwidth}}{\text{chirp time}} = \frac{1.5\times 10^8\ \text{Hz}}{7.\overline{3} \times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}} =
 2.0\overline{45}\times 10^{13}\ \text{Hz/s}
$$

Chirp (sweep) time is set to 5.5 times the beat frequency, to avoid range ambiguity and improve the velocity estimate.

### Simulation Loop

To complete the required steps in this section and in the following ones, I mostly use vectorized operations instead of looping through each single element, as the starter code suggests. In doing so, I do not pre-allocate memory to the variables since MATLAB's internal memory management on vectorized operations is already optimized (source: Udacity GPT).

From the target's initial position and velocity $R$ and $V$, I first compute the vector of range covered by the target vehicle as $\textbf{r}_t = R + V\times\textbf{t}$ (constant velocity model), and from that, the vector of round-trip time as $\mathbf{\tau} = (2\times\textbf{r}_t)/c$ (because the signal travels to the target and back at the speed of light, denoted by $c \approx$ 300,000 km/s). Then, I simulate the transmitted and received signals, $\textbf{T}_t$ and $\textbf{R}_t$, as:

$$
\textbf{T}_t = \cos \Bigl[2 \pi\times \Bigl(f_c\times \textbf{t} + \text{slope}\times \frac{\textbf{t} \odot \textbf{t}}{2}\Bigr)\Bigr]
$$

$$
\textbf{R}_t = \cos \biggl[2 \pi\times \biggl(f_c\times (\textbf{t}-\mathbf{\tau}) + \text{slope}\times \frac{(\textbf{t}-\mathbf{\tau}) \odot (\textbf{t}-\mathbf{\tau})}{2}\biggr)\biggr]
$$

With $f_c = 77\times 10^9$ the carrier frequency, and $\odot$ the Hadamard [2], or element-wise, product. Finally, I calculate the mixed (or beat) signal as the element-wise multiplication:

$$
\textbf{Mix}_t = \textbf{T}_t \odot \textbf{R}_t
$$

### Range FFT

After reshaping the beat signal into a matrix of size $\text{Nr}\times\text{Nd}$ (number of range cells $\times$ number of Doppler cells), a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is run along the range dimension, to convert from time domain $t$ to frequency domain $\omega$. The output (a vector of complex numbers) is then normalized, the absolute value taken, and since it's a double-sided signal only the first half of the samples are kept. The result appears in Figure 1.A: the x-axis starts at 0, so the signal has a peak exactly at $R$. Compared to the starting code, the y-axis is capped at 0.35, and the plot is made full-size (as opposed to a subfigure).

### Range-Doppler Map

The Range-Doppler Map (RDM), generated from a 2D FFT, is already present in the initial code. My contribution was simply to shorten the length of the y-axis (Doppler dimension) to fit within the velocity limits of [-70; +70] m/s [Figure 1.B]. In the plot, the spread of energy along the Doppler axis signals the target's motion.

### 2D CA-CFAR

To remove clutter from unwanted sources such as non-target objects and radar thermal noise, I proceed to implement a 2D Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) algorithm [3] as follows:

1. I start from a matrix of zeros the size of the Range-Doppler Map, and replace the null values in the submatrix delimited by the top-left and the bottom-right Cells Under Test (CUT) with the corresponding content from the RDM [4].

2. In a nested for loop, I run through all the CUT cells in the above submatrix.

3. At each iteration, I compute the aggregate noise level for the training cells around the CUT as the difference between the sum of the elements in two grids: the one containing all cells in scope (training, guard, and test) and the one containing only the guard and test cells. This method deviates from the nested loop procedure the starter code suggests [5], and is done to improve speed. As decibel values cannot be readily summed, I convert them to power using `db2pow` before the operation.

4. The cumulative local noise is then reverted to decibel (a logarithmic measure) with `pow2db`, and an average measure is retrieved. The latter is used to apply boolean masking on the cell under test, which is set to 1 if the signal level of the CUT is greater than the average noise plus the offset, to 0 otherwise.

5. Finally, the noise level is reset for a new pass.

#### Training and Guard Cells

Choosing an appropriate number of training and guard cells in the range and Doppler dimensions involves balancing speed and accuracy: a too small number of cells will disregard important information on the noise and may not prevent spillover from the cell under test; a too large number will instead significantly increase computational time. In this project, I set the number of training cells to 6 (range) and 4 (Doppler), and the number of guard cells to 3 (both dimensions). As a result, on a MacBook Pro M1 Max (64GB RAM) the 2D CA-CFAR algorithm yields the desired output in ~1 second with JIT compilation.

#### Offset

The optimal offset value was found to be 5-6. If the offset is too small (4 or below), a large number of false positives are detected [Figure 2.A]. If it is too large (e.g., 10), the target signal becomes increasingly faint [Figure 2.B].

  <tr>
  <td align="center"><b>Figure 2.A</b>: Large number of false positives (offset = 4)</td>
  <td align="center"><b>Figure 2.B</b>: Faint target signal (offset = 10)</td>

  </tr>

    <td align="center"><img align="center" src="img/img4a.svg" width="475"/></td>
    <td align="center"><img align="center" src="img/img4b.svg" width="475"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Non-Thresholded Edges

Edge suppression is not required because, as mentioned earlier, I initialize a matrix of zeros the size of the RDM and only populate, with contents from the latter, the submatrix that starts at the first and ends at the last CUT cell, in both dimensions. Hence, the band of training and guard cells framing the submatrix already has null components. The final output appears in Figure 3.
